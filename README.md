After you have cloned the project and opened it in the development environment, you need to install the necessary dependencies for the project through the terminal. 
You should use the ``npm install`` command for the root, client and server folders. 
Also ``npm install react-scripts --save`` for root folder. 
After that, going to the root folder, run the project with the ``npm run dev`` command.
